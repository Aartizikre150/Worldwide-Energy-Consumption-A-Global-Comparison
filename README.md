## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **global energy consumption trends**, highlighting disparities across countries, energy sources, and time periods. With rising demand due to **population growth, industrialization, and urbanization**, understanding energy patterns is crucial for shaping a **sustainable energy future**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

The analysis explores fossil fuel dependency, the rise of renewables, and regional consumption differences to provide actionable insights for **policymakers, researchers, and energy companies**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Compare **energy consumption trends among countries** over time.  
- Analyze the **share of renewable energy** in global power generation.  
- Assess **shifts in primary energy consumption by fuel type**.  
- Conduct comparative studies:  
  - Oil demand (2019 vs 2021)  
  - Solar power production across regions  
  - Coal price fluctuations over the years:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
